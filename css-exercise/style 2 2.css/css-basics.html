      <h2>Luo.Z</h2>
   <p class="green">
      <br>Who was born in Shanxi in 2001.
       Graduated from Shanghai Institute of Visual Arts in 2024, 
       now works and lives in Shanghai. Using print, photography, 
       video and other media, her practice focuses on a wide range 
       of topics, from the humanities and history of the market to 
       the imagination and discussion of the future. She deconstructs 
       visual symbols and reproduces the creation of symbols by means 
       of appropriation, collage, and establishment of ironic narratives,
        and uses this to explore larger issues such as consumerism, 
        technology, tradition, and politics.
